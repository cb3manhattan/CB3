"""
Automating SLA Document Creation

The purpose of this script is to automate SLA tasks. This includes the following:

    Creating a table with each component of the application (i.e. address, tradename, etc.)
    Creating folders for each establishment for archiving
    Creating emails, letters, etc.

Process:

    Copy list of items from online agenda into text doc as shown below
    Quickly remove unwanted text from file. Useful text includes Application Type headings and SLA application agenda items.
    Various functions should be designed to have the following outputs:
        A table of the applications with each element parsed out into different columns. One table output should feed directly into the tracking sheet I have.
        Template text with address block, email subject, and text

TO DO

    Start scripting work to input values into template letters
    Create output for excel, which can serve a number of functions:
        a place to input additional info like lawyers name
        track other SLA items

    Create script that inputs area code based on address. Another option is to add this to the tracker and then pull from the tracker and add to the main dataframe.
    Other info from agenda might be useful: License type, app type (method of operation change, etc)

Instructions to create SLA Agenda Text File:

- Copy and paste text from CB 3 Agenda on website. Only copy lines of the agenda that either include application types.
Or application information. Each of the agenda items will be on a separate line, which is important for the parsing scripts
to function properly.

CB3 Agenda Website: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/manhattancb3/calendar/calendar.page
