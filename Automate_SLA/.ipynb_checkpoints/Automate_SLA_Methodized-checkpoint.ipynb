    "Process:\n",
    "1) Copy list of items from online agenda into text doc as shown below\n",
    "2) I will likely want to quickly remove certain text from this, such as section descriptions like 'New Liquor License Applications,' or other info that will not go into the final outputs like the description of the license type. \n",
    "3) The most important thing will likely be keeping each entry to one line in the input file as I will likely use line breaks to parse each item. \n",
    "4) If this doesn't work, another option might be the period (.) followed by blank spaces. \n",
    "5) DBA format seems to be in parentheses after the name. \n",

    "4 - split at period and get first item, which is the numeric agenda item number. \n",

    "TO DO\n",
    " - Create code to remove illegal characters from strings ('B'way' and apostrophes have been replaced)\n",
    " - Start scripting work to input values into template letters\n",
    " - Create output for excel, which can serve a number of functions:\n",
    "     - a place to input additional info like lawyers name\n",
