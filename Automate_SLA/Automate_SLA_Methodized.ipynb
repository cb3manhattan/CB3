    "1) Copy list of items from online agenda into text doc as shown below\n",
    "2) I will likely want to quickly remove certain text from this, such as section descriptions like 'New Liquor License Applications,' or other info that will not go into the final outputs like the description of the license type. \n",

    "TO DO\n",
    " - Create code to remove illegal characters from strings\n",
