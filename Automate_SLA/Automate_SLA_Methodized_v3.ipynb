    "# Automating SLA Document Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "## The purpose of this script is to automate SLA tasks. This includes the following:\n",
    "- Creating a table with each component of the application (i.e. address, tradename, etc.)\n",
    "- Creating folders for each establishment for archiving\n",
    "- Creating emails, letters, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process:\n",
    "1. Copy list of items from online agenda into text doc as shown below\n",
    "2. Quickly remove unwanted text from file. Useful text includes Application Type headings and SLA application agenda items.  \n",
    "3. Various functions should be designed to have the following outputs:\n",
    "    - A table of the applications with each element parsed out into different columns. One table output should feed\n",
    "    directly into the tracking sheet I have.\n",
    "    - Template text with address block, email subject, and text\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## TO DO\n",
    " - Start scripting work to input values into template letters\n",
    " - Create output for excel, which can serve a number of functions:\n",
    "     - a place to input additional info like lawyers name\n",
    "     - track other SLA items\n",
    " - Create function to pull the representative names from the excel tracker and add them to the main dataframe.\n",
    " - Create script that inputs area code based on address. Another option is to add this to the tracker \n",
    " and then pull from the tracker and add to the main dataframe. \n",
    " - Other info from agenda might be useful: License type, app type (method of operation change, etc)\n",
